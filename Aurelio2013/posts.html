		  It is with great sadness I write to let you know that our friend Aurelio Carboni
		  died peacefully this morning, 11 December 2012.
		  <p>
		  We had been friends and collaborators since I first met him in 1980. 
		  I know that all of you who knew him personally will share my distress at
		  his passing. We remember his friendship, his spirit, his humour and his passion for
		  mathematical research.
		  <p>
		  It is a great loss to the Category Theory community.

    	  <p>Dear Colleagues,
		  <p>We are so very sad that Aurelio is so unexpectedly gone. We will sorely
		  miss his unique contributions to our community.
		  <p>It seems only yesterday (but actually it is 40 years)  
		  since he, in Perugia, started to teach me his unique Italian with the same enthusiasm that he applied to 
		  learning category theory. I never ceased to admire his quick grasp of mathematics, and his clear perception 
		  of situations and characters.
		  <p>My life (like the lives of many of us) was enriched by his commentaries both wry and profound, yet 
		  full of humor and kindness and warmth. 
		  <p>As all the friends, I am deeply distressed at saying goodbye to Aurelio.

    	  <p>Dear colleagues and friends,
		  <p>This is quite a shock to me. I regret not having visited him when Bob (Walters) 
		  and Aurelio himself encouraged me to do so. 
		  There was so much I wanted  to discuss with him.
		   I will always remember Aurelio as a great collaborator  for his kindness, 
		   mathematical insights, and humor. He was a good friend as  well. 
		   My sabbatical in Genova was very special because of Marco, Pino, and Aurelio. 
		   My condolences to the categories group.

    	  <p><p>I worked with Aurelio in Milan for a month, about twenty years ago. The
		  routine was that I would come in in the morning and try to understand what
		  he had told me the day before, he would come rushing in just before lunch,
		  we would go and eat, then do some work, go for an espresso, do more work,
		  then go for drinks and supper. The next day the same thing. His ownspecial
		  method of proof is summed up in his phrase "What else could be?" It worked well!
		  <p>It was a wonderful time and I'm very sad I won't see him again.

    	  <p>Others have expressed well many of the sentiments I also feel. Aurelio and Patrizia were very kind to us. Our family loved travelling
		  in his big Citroen and stopping off for delicious gelati on the way home from school.
		  <p>We were a bit worried once, taking Aurelio to an Italian restaurant at Bondi Beach (Papa Giovanni's). 
		  Could be a disaster. We were served our pizzas and were hoeing in. We noticed some mild activity with 
		  Aurelio's hands involving putting his finger to his cheek and other things. 
		  Then Aurelio stood up. We asked where he was going. He said the chef 
		  had invited him to taste the spaghetti he himself was eating at another table. Not a word had been spoken.
		  <p>So many memories, personal and mathematical.

    	  <p><p>I miss him very much. Especially because doing mathematics with him was a lot of fun. His humor, his naturalness, 
		  his spontaneity were like a force of nature. And I was very lucky as I could receive his harsh criticisms directly in 
		  his mother language, and respond.
		  <p>And I always remember with joy the very long night we spent together, when we met at 6pm EST at the gate 
		  of a flight from JFK to Denver; coming from different places across the Atlantic, each had missed his connecting 
		  flight. For a technical problem, we then sat at the gate for four hours waiting for a replacement aircraft. We got 
		  to Denver at 4am MST, arriving in Boulder at 7am in time for breakfast. Yet he made it the most absolutely delightful 
		  trip for me.

    	  <p><p>We were colleagues at Genoa, for a few years in 1993-96, and had a paper together on a matter of common 
		  interest but based on his initial idea and intuition. In that period, we had the pleasure of having Marta Bunge with 
		  us, during her sabbatical in 1993-94, as she already recalled in her message.
		  <p>Then he moved back to Milano and later to Como, and I only met him at 
		  conferences and meetings. I regret we had no further occasions of working together.
		  <p>I am shocked, as so many of his colleagues and friends.

    	  <p><p>This is really sad news. Aurelio was a unique person, merging mathematical insight, humour and one, 
		  his very own, disenchanted sense of life. The latter was a recurrent subject of debate between us every time we met,
		  since the first time at the State University of Milan in 1983, during a seminar in
		  logic. His remarks, in the form of criticism and suggestion on specific
		  topics of research, were always helpful to grasp the point of a problem,
		  seen from his own, deep, understanding of mathematics.

    	  <p><p>In 1994 in Tours at the Category Theory Conference Aurelio Carboni gave a talk. When he came to give the proof of his announced theorem he said in his inimitable way:
		  <div align="center">What else could be?</div>
		  <p><p>This caused a certain consternation in some sections of the audience, which I understood.
		  <p>However the point I wish to make in this post is that Aurelio seems to have been wiser, and closer to my position, than those who now advocate the total formalization of mathematics and logic in some formal proof system, based on type theory.
		  <p>Aurelio often said that the main problem is to get the definitions right.
		  <p>A crucial problem of mathematics is to understand what is important and interesting, and what we learn about the world from it.
		  <p>Incidentally, Aurelio was very interested in making mathematics of proof theory; not in making mathematics into type-theory pseudocode.

    	  <p><p>This is my recollection of my working with Aurelio in Genova. 
		  The outcome of this joint work was a jewel of a paper, called 
		  "The Symmetric Topos", and published in the JPPA. 
		  I can say that it is a jewel since, although I had proved elsewhere 
		  (Algebra Universalis) the original conjecture of Bill Lawvere to the 
		  effect that the symmetric topos exists as classifier of Lawvere distributions, 
		  the way of doing things in our joint paper has Aurelio's mark all over it.  
		  Instead of forcing (in the set-theoretic or topos-theoretic sense) 
		  the existence of the symmetric topos, as I had done, he suggested constructing 
		  it using the finite limits completion on the sites. This way of doing it unifies 
		  ring theory and topos theory. Bello! We had envisaged a sequel to our work, 
		  but that never happened. 
		  <p>
		  Working with Aurelio was fun and terribly exciting. The fun came from the 
		  fact that we would work at odd places - during lunch, on an outing in his 
		  fast car, and even during his taking oral examinations at Universita di Genova. 
		  This was a far cry from my working in offices with previous collaborators. 
		  I found that, this way, we would concentrate on the ideas - leaving the 
		  details to be worked afterwards. His intuition (almost) never failed, 
		  so this sort of work was actually productive. Coming back to Aurelio, 
		  what I liked most about him was his frankness, but the same time his 
		  friendship, optimism, and encouragement. 
		  <p>
		  My first recollection of Aurelio was at a workshop on Categorical Methods 
		  in Geometry at Aarhus, organized by Anders Kock. Aurelio was young, eager, 
		  more serious than what he later became. Maybe Anders has a picture of young 
		  Aurelio listening attentively to Bill Lawvere in the garden of his house. 
		  In another photograph, we are at lunch in the same garden, with Aurelio 
		  sitting on my left, talking  across the table to Gavin Wraith, Imogen Kelly 
		  and Andy Pitts. I looked very young myself, so it must have been at least 
		  about 20 years ago. I do not remember dates , but I could check on all the 
		  ones that are missing from this account. I could also look for the photographs 
		  that I mentioned. 
		  <p>
		  For now, what I have are the memories of the many meetings in which I talked 
		  to Aurelio. At CT 2010, I asked Bob Walters what was the matter with Aurelio 
		  since he was not there (Calais) and that was not at all like him. I asked Bob 
		  if in fact Aurelio was ill. The response was that it was "worse" - that what 
		  happened was that he was "disappointed".  Well, as it turned out, he was, or 
		  must have been ill already then, and nobody noticed it. I could not believe 
		  that Aurelio was in any way depressed but asked no more. I said to Bob that 
		  I would like to see Aurelio, and he told this to Aurelio,  who encouraged me 
		  to go visit him. As it usually happens, I am not that free to plan my travels, 
		  so I did not. I am so very very sorry that I did not. If only time could go 
		  backwards... .
